        <h4>
          Blossoms is a product of PlantTech Limited.We came up with the idea 
          to build<br></br> a marketplace for plants and flowers <br></br>in Kenya after we struggled 
          to find an online plant vendor in Kenya<br></br> while we were looking to buy plants 
          for our offices.<br></br> We combined our desire for nature and passion for innovation 
          to<br></br> make buying flowers and plants in Kenya easier and tadaaa ...<br></br> Blossoms was born. 
          A smarter way to buy, sell and discover the magic of flowers and plants.
