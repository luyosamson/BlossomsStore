## Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have
the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to
stretch your skills.

You'll have to add additional elements for these features. Feel free to style
them however you see fit!

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure
> to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user:

1. I can update the price of a plant and still see the updated price after
   refreshing the page.
2. I can delete a plant and it is still gone when I refresh the page.
